This tutorial shows you how to

+   Install Tekton Triggers.
+   Create a TriggerTemplate.
+   Create a TriggerBind.
+   Create an EventListener.

This guide uses a local cluster with [minikube][].

## Before you begin

1.  Complete the two previous Getting Started tutorials: [Tasks][gs-tasks] and
    [Pipelines][gs-pipelines]. *Do not clean up your resources*, skip the last
    section.

1.  Install [curl][] if it's not already available on your system.

## Overview

You can use Tekton Triggers to modify the behavior of your CI/CD Pipelines
depending on external events. The basic implementation you are going to create
in this guide comprises three main components:

1.  An `EventListener` object that listens to the world waiting for "something"
    to happen.

1.  A `TriggerTemplate` object, which configures a PipelineRun when this
    event occurs.

1.  A `TriggerBinding` object, that passes the data to the PipelineRun created
    by the `TriggerTemplate` object.

An optional `ClusterInterceptor` object can be added to validate and process
event data.

You are going to create a Tekton Trigger to run the `hello-goodbye` Pipeline
when the EventListener detects an event.

## Install Tekton Triggers

1.  Use `kubectl` to install Tekton Triggers:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename \
    https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/triggers/latest/release.yaml
    kubectl apply --filename \
    https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/triggers/latest/interceptors.yaml
    ```

1.  Monitor the installation:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --namespace tekton-pipelines --watch
    ```

    When `tekton-triggers-controller`, `tekton-triggers-webhook`, and
    `tekton-triggers-core-interceptors` show `1/1` under the `READY` column, you
    are ready to continue. For example:

    ```
    NAME                                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    tekton-events-controller-786b59d5cd-jt7d9           1/1     Running   0          5m43s
    tekton-pipelines-controller-59b6cdbbc-2kw2w         1/1     Running   0          5m43s
    tekton-pipelines-webhook-74b5cdfcc4-g4qj2           1/1     Running   0          5m43s
    tekton-triggers-controller-784d896c7f-s5c7s         1/1     Running   0          85s
    tekton-triggers-core-interceptors-54d9f764b-g5vbh   1/1     Running   0          84s
    tekton-triggers-webhook-666c844478-4cqcv            1/1     Running   0          85s
    ```

    Hit *Ctrl + C* to stop monitoring.

## Create a TriggerTemplate

A TriggerTemplate defines what happens when an event is detected.

1.  Create a new file named `trigger-template.yaml` and add the following:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: TriggerTemplate
    metadata:
      name: hello-template
    spec:
      params:
      - name: username
        default: "Kubernetes"
      resourcetemplates:
      - apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
        kind: PipelineRun
        metadata:
          generateName: hello-goodbye-run-
        spec:
          pipelineRef:
            name: hello-goodbye
          params:
          - name: username
            value: $(tt.params.username)
    ```

    The `PipelineRun` object that you created in the previous tutorial is now
    included in the template declaration. This trigger expects the `username`
    parameter to be available; if it's not, it assigns a default value:
    "Kubernetes".

1.  Apply the TriggerTemplate to your cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f trigger-template.yaml
    ```

## Create a TriggerBinding

A TriggerBinding executes the TriggerTemplate, the same way you had to create a
PipelineRun to execute the Pipeline.

1.  Create a file named `trigger-binding.yaml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: TriggerBinding
    metadata:
      name: hello-binding
    spec: 
      params:
      - name: username
        value: $(body.username)
    ```

    This TriggerBinding gets some information and saves it in the `username`
    variable.

1.  Apply the TriggerBinding:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f trigger-binding.yaml
    ```

## Create an EventListener

The `EventListener` object encompasses both the TriggerTemplate and the
TriggerBinding. 

1.  Create a file named `event-listener.yaml` and add the following:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: EventListener
    metadata:
      name: hello-listener
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: tekton-robot
      triggers:
        - name: hello-trigger 
          bindings:
          - ref: hello-binding
          template:
            ref: hello-template
    ```

    This declares that when an event is detected, it will run the TriggerBinding
    and the TriggerTemplate.

1.  The EventListener requires a service account to run. To create the service
    account for this example create a file named `rbac.yaml` and add the
    following:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: tekton-robot
    ---
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: triggers-example-eventlistener-binding
    subjects:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: tekton-robot
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: tekton-triggers-eventlistener-roles
    ---
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: triggers-example-eventlistener-clusterbinding
    subjects:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: tekton-robot
      namespace: default
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: tekton-triggers-eventlistener-clusterroles
    ```

    This service account allows the EventListener to create PipelineRuns.

1.  Apply the file to your cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
    ```

##  Running the Trigger

You have everything you need to run this Trigger and start listening for events.

1.  Create the EventListener:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f event-listener.yaml
    ```

1.  To communicate outside the cluster, enable port-forwarding:

    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward service/el-hello-listener 8080
    ```

    The output confirms that port-forwarding is working:

    ```
    kubectl port-forward service/el-hello-listener 8080
    Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080
    Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8080    
    ```

    Keep this service running, don't close the terminal.

##  Monitor the Trigger

Now that the EventListener is running, you can send an event and see what
happens:

1.  Open a new terminal and submit a payload to the cluster:

    ```bash
    curl -v \
       -H 'content-Type: application/json' \
       -d '{"username": "Tekton"}' \
       http://localhost:8080
    ```

    You can change "Tekton" for any string you want. This value will be
    ultimately read by the `goodbye-world` Task.

    The response is successful:

    ```
    < HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
    < Content-Type: application/json
    < Date: Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:03:34 GMT
    < Content-Length: 164
    <
    {"eventListener":"hello-listener","namespace":"default","eventListenerUID":"c2905e72-8036-4f6a-b26e-f390e8615b76","eventID":"8747199c-b96e-488c-9c44-d43b368b877b"}
    * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
    ```

1.  This event triggers a PipelineRun, check the PipelineRuns on your
    cluster :

    ```bash
    kubectl get pipelineruns
    ```

    The output confirms the pipeline is working:

    ```
    NAME                      SUCCEEDED   REASON      STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
    hello-goodbye-run         True        Succeeded   6m24s       6m2s
    hello-goodbye-run-r4qg4   True        Succeeded   44s         34s
    ```

    You see two PipelineRuns, the first one created in the previous guide,
    the last one was created by the Trigger.

1.	Check the PipelineRun logs. The name is auto-generated adding a suffix
    for every run, in this case it's `hello-goodbye-run-8hckl`. Use your own
    PiepelineRun name in the following command to see the logs:

    ```bash
    tkn pipelinerun logs --last -f
    ```

    And you get the expected output:

    ```
    [hello : echo] Hello World

    [goodbye : goodbye] Goodbye Tekton!
    ```

     Both Tasks completed successfuly. Congratulations!


## Clean up

1.  Press *Ctrl + C* in the terminal running the port-forwarding process to stop
    it.

1.  Delete the cluster:

    ```bash
    minikube delete
    ```

    The output confirms that the cluster was deleted:

    ```
   ðŸ”¥  Deleting "minikube" in qemu2 ...
   ðŸ’€  Removed all traces of the "minikube" cluster.
    ```
