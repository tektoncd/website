Tekton is a cloud-native solution for building CI/CD systems. It consists of
Tekton Pipelines, which provides the building blocks, and of supporting
components, such as Tekton CLI and Tekton Catalog, that make Tekton a complete
ecosystem.  Tekton is part of the [CD Foundation](https://cd.foundation/), a
[Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/) project. For more
information, see the [Overview of Tekton](/docs/concepts/overview/).
