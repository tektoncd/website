The [Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)][cdf-website] is happy to host its
fourth flagship event, cdCon, taking place on May 8–9, 2023 in Vancouver,
Canada as [cdCon + GitOpsCon][cdcon-gitopscon-website], co-organized with the
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)][cncf-website], making it the
must-attend event for anyone who is involved in CD, DevOps, and GitOps.

By combining the two events, cdCon + GitOpsCon aims to bring their communities
together to collaborate and build the future of GitOps and CD. The program
committees reviewed more than 250 submissions and selected over 60 sessions
that will span topics from technical challenges and deep dives, to end-user
stories and introductory content.

The [cdCon + GitOpsCon program][cdcon-gitopscon-program] contains sessions from
the most widely used CI/CD and GitOps technologies. The Tekton Community will
be there with project updates and various talks from our community members and
users. Here are some of the sessions you don’t want to miss.

- [Operating Tekton with Secure Defaults][tekton-talk-1] - Christie Wilson Warwick & Wendy Dembowski, Google
- [Tekton Project Update and Roadmap][tekton-talk-2] - Andrea Frittoli, IBM
- [Save Your Pipelines (and Clusters!) with Tekton Results][tekton-talk-3] - Adam Kaplan, Red Hat & Dibyo Mukherjee, Google
- [Tekton Supply Chain Security][tekton-talk-4] - Billy Lynch, Chainguard

In addition to these sessions, Andrea Frittoli of IBM, a member of the Tekton
Governance Committee and maintainer will take part in [the Graduated Projects
Keynote Panel][graduated-projects-panel], discussing Tekton Community’s
experiences with graduation and sharing his thoughts on why graduation matters
for the community and users of Tekton.

We look forward to an awesome event and we hope to see you there!
