[Tekton](https://tekton.dev) is a cloud native continuous integration and
delivery (CI/CD) solution. It allows developers to build, test, and deploy
across cloud providers and on-premises systems.

In this scenario, you will learn about Tekton tasks, the basic building block
of CI/CD pipelines in Tekton. More specifically, **you will use a Tekton task
to check if an app can connect to a remote server; this task will download
the source code from GitHub, spin up a mock server, and run tests against it**.

**Note**: You can use the resize button on the top-right corner of this
