This directory includes the configuration for syncing/curating contents from
specific Tekton repositories.

See `pipelines.yaml` and `triggers.yaml` for more instructions. These two
YAML files control the synchronization/curation from the `tektoncd/pipeline`
and `tektoncd/triggers` repositories respectively.

The YAML files here are used by the scripts in `../sync`.
