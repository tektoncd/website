# Each YAML file under sync/ configures how sync/sync.py synchronizes
# contents of various versions from its source of truth (usually a GitHub
# repository of a Tekton component, such as tektoncd/pipelines) to
# content/ (for the lastest version) and vault/ (for earlier versions).

# The name of the component.
# sync.py will use this value to build directories in content/ and vault/.
component: Triggers
# The GitHub repository where documentation resides.
repository: https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers
# The link to the GitHub tag page.
archive: https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/tags
# The tags (versions) of contents to sync.
# Note that sync.py and related script reads tags in the order specified in
# the following list; the first entry in tags will automatically become the
# latest version of contents.
# To add a new version, append to the list as below
# - name: vX.Y.Z
